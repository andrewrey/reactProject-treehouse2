Continuation of the TeamTreehouse React Course building the Scoreboard application with create-react-app

**TeamTreeHouse Scoreboard: React Components**
This course is a continuation from the previous TeamTreeHouse React Basics course. It continues to cover the following topics, but this time uses the Create-React-App to build the scoreboard.

 1. Props
 2. State
 3. React Elements
 4. React Components (Function and Classes)

The scoreboard is used to teach how to pass data via Props from State. As well how to update state depending on events as well introduces students to the create-react-app build tool.
